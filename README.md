# Auto-youtube-video-downloader
An auto youtube  video downloader that auto downloads a youtube video when you copy its link👍. I created this cuz i was tired of manually downloading youtube videos😑

It works by using the python extension "pytube" to download the videos and "androidhelper" to automate the tasks.

Built with an android app called "qpython 3l" and works well with the app. Not sure about other android apps though.
